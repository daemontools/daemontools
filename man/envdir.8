.TH envdir 8
.SH NAME
envdir \- runs another program with environment modified according to files
in a specified directory.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B envdir
.I d
.I child
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I d
is a single argument.
.I child
consists of one or more arguments. 

.B envdir
sets various environment variables as specified by files in the directory
named
.IR d .
It then runs
.IR child .

If
.I d
contains a file named
.I s
whose first line is
.IR t ,
.B envdir
removes an environment variable named
.I s
if one exists, and then adds an environment variable named
.I s
with value
.IR t .
The name
.I s
must not contain =. Spaces and tabs at the end of
.I t
are removed. Nulls in
.I t
are changed to newlines in the environment variable. 

If the file
.I s
is completely empty (0 bytes long),
.B envdir
removes an environment variable named
.I s
if one exists, without adding a new variable.
.SH EXIT CODES
.B envdir
exits 111 if it has trouble reading
.IR d ,
if it runs out of memory for environment variables, or if it cannot run
.IR child .
Otherwise its exit code is the same as that of
.IR child .
