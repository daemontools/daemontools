.TH readproctitle 8
.SH NAME
readproctitle \- maintains an automatically rotated log in memory for
inspection by
.BR ps (1).

readproctitle is available in daemontools 0.75 and above.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B readproctitle
.I L
.I D
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I L
consists of any number of arguments.
.I D
is one argument consisting of at least five dots.

.B readproctitle
reads data into the end of
.IR D ,
shifting
.I D
to the left to make room. This means that the most recent data is visible
to process-listing tools such as
.BR ps (1).
.B readproctitle
always leaves three dots at the left of
.IR D .

For example, if

 readproctitle io errors: ....................

reads the data

 fatal error xyz
 warning abc

then its command-line arguments change to

 readproctitle io errors: ... xyz!warning abc!

with a newline character in place of each !. Process-listing tools typically
show the newline character as ? or \\n.

.B readproctitle
exits when it reaches the end of input.

Beware that most implementations of
.BR ps (1)
have small argument-length limits. These limits apply to the total length
of
.B readproctitle
.I L
.IR D .
I have not seen a system with a limit below 512 bytes.
