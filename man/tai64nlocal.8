.TH tai64nlocal 8
.SH NAME
tai64nlocal \- converts precise TAI64N timestamps to a human-readable format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tai64nlocal
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tai64nlocal
reads lines from stdin. If a line does not begin with @,
.B tai64nlocal
writes it to stdout without change. If a line begins with @,
.B tai64nlocal
looks for a timestamp after the @, in the format printed by
.BR tai64n (8),
and writes the line to stdout with the timestamp converted to local time in
ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSSSSSSSS. 

For example, in the US/Pacific time zone, the input line 

  @4000000037c219bf2ef02e94 mark

should be printed as 

  1999-08-23 21:03:43.787492500 mark

Beware, however, that the current implementation of
.B tai64nlocal
relies on the UNIX localtime library routine to find the local time. Some
localtime implementations use a broken time scale that does not account for
leap seconds. On systems that use the Olson tz library (with an up-to-date
leap-second table), you can fix this problem by setting your time zone to,
e.g, right/US/Pacific instead of US/Pacific.

Beware also that most localtime implementations are not Y2038-compliant.

.B tai64nlocal
does not allocate any memory after it starts, except possibly
inside localtime.
.SH EXIT CODES
.B tai64nlocal
exits 0 when it sees end of input. It exits 111 without an error message if it
has trouble reading stdin or writing stdout.
